# mxWeb Trainer
Welcome to `mxweb-trainer`, the learn-by-doing repo for Matrix.

Matrix is the generic, point-reactive engine that began as Common Lisp [Cells](https://github.com/kennytilton/cells) twenty-five years ago. Gasp. It manages even the most complex, asynchronous application state transparently and automatically. The #1 use case for automatic state management is building GUI interfaces, so our Matrix trainer is also a trainer in using mxWeb.

Matrix has native versions for both JS and CLJS. mxWeb stacks exist in varying degrees of completeness for:
* JS + HTML/CSS;
* CLJS + HTML/CSS;
* CJLS + React web; and
* CLJS + ReactNative.

We will port this trainer to all the above RSN, but for now we just have the [CLJS+HTML/CSS](https://github.com/kennytilton/mxweb-trainer/tree/main/cljs) version.
