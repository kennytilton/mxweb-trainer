# mxWeb Trainer
Welcome to `mxweb-trainer`, the learn-by-doing repo for Matrix, in turn the generic, point-reactive engine that began as Common Lisp [Cells](https://github.com/kennytilton/cells) twenty-five years ago. Gasp.

The #1 use case for automatic state management is building GUI interfaces, so our Matrix trainer is also a trainer in using mxWeb.
